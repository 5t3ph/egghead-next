## Extra Credit

### 1. Updating our Next.js app's page title

Since our goal is to ultimately create a new ecommerce store, we don't want our page title to say "Welcome to Next.js" at the top.

Update the page title (`<h1>`) and description (`<p>`) at the top of the page to something that describes your new store.

> ðŸ‘‹ **Hey! Quick note**

> This change won't persist through the lesson material, but now is a good time to understand how Next.js works!

#### Where We'll Make Changes

- `pages/index.js`

import ResourceLayout from 'components/pages/projects/layouts/resource'

export const Sidebar = () => <div />

export default ({meta, children}) => (
  <ResourceLayout meta={meta} sidebar={<Sidebar />}>
    {children}
  </ResourceLayout>
)
