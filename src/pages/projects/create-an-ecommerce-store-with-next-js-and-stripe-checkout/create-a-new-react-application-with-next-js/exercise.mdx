## Getting Started

For our first lesson, we're going to walk through building a Next.js app from scratch.

The best part of creating a Next.js app from scratch, is Next.js provides us with all of the tools we need to get up and running quickly with a single line in the terminal.

## Exercises

### 1. Creating a new Next.js app with Create Next App

As you notice, this first lesson directory is empty. That's on purpose!

Our very first exercise is creating a new Next.js app from scratch.

To do this, Next.js provides an easy-to-use tool called Create Next App that we can run right from our terminal that creates a new project, installs the dependencies, and gets us up and running in no time.

This tool uses npm or yarn to clone a repository and run any scripts that gets the project ready to use.

#### Resources

- [Create Next App](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/create-next-app) (nextjs.org)

### 2. Exploring our new Next.js app

After Create Next App finishes running, we should now be ready to start up our local development server and Next.js provides us right away with the commands we should use.

With our local development server up and running, we can get familiar with some of the features Next.js provides out of the box. This includes making changes to our code, such as changing the title of the page, and watching our app automatically update right inside of the browser.

Take some time to look around the project files and Next.js documentation to get an idea of what you just created.
